# 02285 - Artificial Intelligence and Multi-Agent Systems

This repository contains a AI written in C# capable of providing solutions in a multi-agent environment.

The grid-based levels contains boxes, goal cells for boxes, and agents that can move boxes around. To complete a level, all goal cells must be occupied by boxes matching their alphabetic letter. The agents can only move boxes matching their own colours.

This project was submitted to an AI&MAS competition, and reached total second-place out of 26 entries. The success of the project depended on three factors: How many level submission our AI could solve, how optimal the generated solutions were, and the computation time for the solutions. The images below are examples of levels our AI could solve.
